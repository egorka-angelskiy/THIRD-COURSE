        GenPC aka GEMA is a new symbolic assembler for MS-DOS. It is
mainly based upon the 68k reference : GenST on Atari ST. Moreover the logical
structure of Motorola 680x0 was adapted to Intel mnemonics, as it is actually
easier and more logical. Opposed to TASM that wants to get a lousy pseudo-
structurated style and features lotsa bugs ( especially with 386+ instructions
), and doesn't let us really guess how our source codes will be assembled, GEMA
let you enjoy heavy coding and was especially designed for 32-bit processing.
        It now supports all the opcodes of Intel processors, from 8086 to P6,
including all discovered, but undocumented opcodes !

	In addition, it is really faster than TASM, doesn't need any linker,
and features handy assembly directives, especially INCBIN, that has always been
missing on TASM and MASM.

	If you never coded in machine language before, GEMA is the tool you
need to discover the marvellous ( well... just about ) world of 80x86. And
you'll be easily able to learn 680x0 if you need to.

	If you already know the 680x0 joys, you won't have to worry about the
lousiness of Intel stuff anymore and won't yell about the lameness of the
classical assembly tools.

	If you're coding on 80x86, you must fed up with TASM and MASM. So that
GEMA is the assembler you need ! It is especially designed for 32-bit coding
( protected or flat-real modes ) and is really easy to use in this context,
opposed to the
